# Northern-Aerospace-Case-Analysis
This case study is based on scandinavian(north europe) profitable and growing airline company Northern Aerospace after several tough years. 
It asks to evaluate the Frequent flyer loyalty program. If it is really worth spending on the program for company's growth is the question of chief Marketing Officer. Zenith consultants are currently customer relationship management (CRM) and information technology (IT) consultants for northern aerospace. 

## Using the given data, case study asks the following questions:
• The lifetime value of a typical customer in each segment.
• If the existing customers were to be economically valued, as an asset of the company, how much would they be worth?
• “What is the return on investment of the loyalty program?” What answer (or answers) would you give to that question? Notice that your answer might vary, depending on the time horizon considered. Use a 15% discount rate and explain your choices.
• The results of the ZENITH consultants’ analysis and efforts to optimize customer lifetime value are shown in the Enginius data blocks Segment data (optimization) and Transition matrix (optimization) and Table 3 of the Appendix. What do they recommend, and what are the key insights from their analysis?
Are they recommending an increase or a decrease in the overall loyalty program budget? According to their recommendations, how should the budget be allocated?
• What would you recommend to the Board? Why? How would you justify your strategy? You can follow ZENITH’s recommendations, adapt them, or ignore them altogether, but
you must make up your mind now and propose a plan for the next year. What would it be ?
• Managing customer lifetime value is a process, and so is the research program designed to support it. As a way to proceed,reflect on the results of ZENITH’s analyses and summarize:
What has been achieved already, and how has this analysis helped Northern Aero so far?
• What needs to be done to help Northern Aero make even better, more informed decisions in the future? Think in terms of tools, insights, data, simulations,
model, and so forth.
